# Boxy Theme Kit

A set of color themes based on Sublime's [Boxy Theme](https://github.com/ihodev/sublime-boxy).

All props go to Boxy Theme's author Ihor Oleksandrov. I just republish these theme files to VSCode Marketplace.

My favorite theme in this set is Tomorrow, so I'll keep enhancing its syntax color.
For other themes, please feel free to send PR, I'll publish changes as soon as possible.

## Boxy Monokai

## Boxy Nova

## Boxy Ocean

## Boxy Tomorrow

This theme is based on the original Tomorrow Night theme with better syntax coloring for
HTML, XML, Markdown, JSON, etc.
