# Boxy Theme Kit

A set of color themes based on Sublime's [Boxy Theme](https://github.com/ihodev/sublime-boxy).

All props go to Boxy Theme's author Ihor Oleksandrov. I just republish these theme files to VSCode Marketplace.

My favorite theme in this set is Tomorrow (Night), so I'll keep fixing its syntax color and tweaking the workbench theme to match.

For other themes, please feel free to send PR (please respect the original theme, just fix the coloring issues), I'll publish changes as soon as possible.

## Boxy Tomorrow

- This theme is based on the original Tomorrow Night theme with better syntax coloring for HTML, XML, Markdown, JSON, etc.
- The comment doc tags were dimmed to avoid clutter.
